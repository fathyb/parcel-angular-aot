This is a simple example of lazyloading Angular routes with a Parcel development server using `parcel-plugin-typescript`.

- `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- `yarn start` to start up development server
- `yarn build:dev` build for development
- `yarn build:prod` build for production (minified)

You need to be running node > 9.3.0.
